Hello! At the beginning of every new chat session, your first task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the entire project. Do not limit your understanding to the `README.md` file. You must thoroughly examine the file structure, the source code in the `src/` directory, the component library in `src/components/`, the application pages in `src/app/`, and any other relevant files to gain a deep understanding of the project's architecture, features, and current state. Your subsequent responses should be informed by this detailed, holistic view of the codebase.
